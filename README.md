# Summer-Scratch-Game

Game made in Scratch. Created in the Summer of 2019!! BEFORE high school!

---

### Preview:

As much as I loved this game, I sadly cannot find the file for it. I created it with a friend during our summer just before freshman year of high school! Since we lost access to our high school accounts (as we are now college students), that means that we also lost access to the code of this really fun, quick summer game we made. All I have left is this quick video on how it looked and ran. This video shows our game in its early stages, with only two levels. After this video was taken, we added more awesome levels! So all I have left here is this video. 

Perhaps one day I will have the time to sit down and recreate it! Please enjoy this short video, and read through the creative process it took to create this two level game. Thank you!

### Brainstorm:

It all started when my friend and I were at a computer science camp. We were there prepping for the beginning of our high school career, and they were having a video game contest. They wanted kids to randomly pair up and make a game. So my friend Sammy, and I paired up to make a game. 

We wanted it to be a fun, and easy game because we were quite bereft of game-creating knowledge. He wanted to do a fun maze game, and I wanted to do a quick battle with a fantastical element. Together we compromised and composed of a game that had both ideas act as game levels.

### Precoding/Planning:

Once we knew what levels and elements we wanted, we started sketching out how we wanted our game to look. We made our protaganist, a cute comforting circle, our ultimate antaganist, a evil looking triangle, and our sequence of levels.

First would be his maze solving level, and then my battle against the triangle. For each level, we figured out what colors we wanted, and what the background would look like. Once we made a general sketch, we got to work.

### Creation Time:

Coding on Scratch is a great way to get started. I loved coding on this platform, and found it super encouraging to get more and more creative. Sammy and I shared duties most of the times. I would code quite a lot, and give direction on how I wanted to game the look. Sammy would do a great job in making my vision a reality, while also helping me code here and there. 

Overall, it was a great collaraboration effort, and we benefited greatly by communicating our ideas and opinions.

### Difficulties Encountered:

From what I remember, it seemed that I had trouble figuring out how I wanted the boss to come after the hero. I wasn't sure if I wanted it to throw fireballs or spikes, or I wanted it to chase after the hero. After deciding I wanted it to chase, it was figuring out how to have the hero beat the boss. 

It was the idea to create a sword sprite, and have it be "collected" by the hero, and then used by the hero made my head get scratched a bit. Especially since I wanted the hero to be able to point the sword at the boss, and essentially stab or poke it. In order to point it at the boss, I had to learn how to have the sword follow the mouse, and have the "Boss Lives:" go down. This was a bit of a learning and educational curve, but luckily Sammy and I did not give up on making this feature happen!

### Reception:

Eventually the time ran out for the competition, and we submitted our game with every element we wanted and planned for. To our great fortune, we won the game-creating contest! It was applauded for having more advanced gameplay than the others, and for having fairly great art. Sammy and I were very very happy!

### Final Thoughts:

Overall, I absolutely loved this game for a number of reasons! I love how it looked, I love how my vision and Sammy's came to life. And I love that it looks good without trying so hard. It is simple in its colors and objectives, but it is still fun! 

I hold this game near and dear to my heart, beause it was one of the first ones I made while having art involved! It also is a great reminder of my times working with one who would eventually become a very good friend of mine. Please enjoy the remains that I have of this game!
